# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

This project provides a visual representation of earthquakes and tectonic plates throughout the world for the last 7 days.  The earthquakes severity is represented by colors that are defined in a legend on the bottom right of the browser.  

The webpage offers different layers and base maps too allow the user to establish a view that aligns with their preference.  Each bubble provides magnitue information and location information.
